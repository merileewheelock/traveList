# traveList
## Made with React, Redux, Express, MySQL, Javascript, jQuery, Booststrap, CSS, and SASS

### Overview
traveList is a web app designed to help travelers stay organized and prepared during all types of travel. The project was inspired by a friend who went on a business trip and noted the difference in packing for business versus packing for leisure. This was created as a tool to help users plan for their upcoming trips based on the type of trip they are taking, including types and settings such as business, international, beach, winter, and many more.

### Challenges and Solutions
#### JavaScript is Asynchronous
When creating the survey, we wanted users to be asked each question individually. Based on their answer, they would be given a series of questions based on the options they chose. As an example, if a user chose Business, they would be asked if it was International, Formal, or Casual â€“ it would not show the Beach or Winter options, etc. Since JavaScript is asynchronous, the option the user chose would not be passed into the database before the page re-rendered.
#### Creating a Single-Page Look in React
React is known for utilizing components to let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. Since components re-render the DOM when routing to new Links, it was a challenge to maintain a single-page experience. To solve this, we created a Container component that housed the single-page components that we wanted to display on the main page. With that, we linked navigation links to jump to the specific div on the page.
#### Creating a MySQL Database From Scratch
In order for the page to display the appropriate packing list items based on the user's answers to the survey questions, our team had to organize the MySQL database to associate each of the packing list items with certain survey answers.Having said that, one of the challenges we faced was organizing the data tables so that it displays the right packing list information on the page for the user. To solve this, we created a workflow diagram to brainstorm the table categories for each survey answer path.

### Code Snippets
#### Insert Survey Results into tripInfo MySQL Database Table
```
const getUidQuery = `SELECT id from users WHERE token=?`
connection.query(getUidQuery, [token], (error,results)=>{
    console.log(token)
    if(error) throw error;
    if(results.length == 0){
        res.json({msg:"badToken"})
    }else{
        const addToTripsQuery = `INSERT INTO tripInfo (uid, tripType, tripSetting, destination, tripDate, children)
            VALUES (?,?,?,?,?,?)`
        connection.query(addToTripsQuery, [results[0].id, tripType, tripSetting, destination, tripDate, children], (error2,results2)=>{
            console.log(tripDate);
            console.log("****error2****")
            console.log(error2)
            if (error2) throw error2;
            res.json({
                tripInfoId: results2.insertId
            })
            // console.log(results2)
        })
    }
})
```
#### Using React-Redux Logic to Navigate Users Through the Survey Questions
```
handleButton(value){

    if (this.state.currentQuestion === 1){
        this.setState({
            tripType: value
        });
    }

    if (this.state.currentQuestion === 2){
        this.setState({
            tripSetting: value
        });
    }

    if (this.state.currentQuestion === 5){
        this.setState({
            children: value
        });
    }

    var current = (this.state.currentQuestion).toString();
    var next = (this.state.currentQuestion + 1).toString();


    if (this.state.currentQuestion === this.state.totalQuestions){
        $('#next').addClass('not-visible');
        $('#submit').removeClass('not-visible');
    }else{   
        $('.question-'+current).addClass('not-visible');
        $('.question-'+next).removeClass('not-visible');
     
        var currentQuestionUpdate = this.state.currentQuestion + 1

        this.setState({
            currentQuestion: currentQuestionUpdate
        });        
    }
}
```
